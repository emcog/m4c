## Theme

A jekyll/static-site built on Grid and Flex-box. Integrating SaaS for contact forms.

## About 

Having abandoned "learning to code" many many times over the years, I've come to learn quite a bit. The first time I abandonded it I wanted more control over my layouts than html, tables, css would afford and I didn't see a future in digital. True. 

Before learning to code, I wanted to learn to design. To make information legible and accessible. Along the way I had to learn quite a lot about cognition and learning styles. 

Being a detail focused, some may say fussy, designer I always wanted to spec the look, feel and details and never found much satisfaction from templates. Except in seeing how they were contstructed and applied.

Design intention
Mix-together poster styles, and contemporary font-styles with a functional UX.
Many digital products have one graphic style for their interface and one for their advertising campaigns. There are many benefits for this. Ability to parse audience targeting from users. Users can be more broad and address functionality. Audiences can be specific and will respond to campaigns.

So why have I fused the the two?
I never thought about this specifically until writing it
Wanted to use the a certain design language to give an attitude
Don't have much advertising budget
Want users to share 
Interesting challenge

Design refrences
Always been interested in sequecnces of images and meta-narrative
First styles came out from work I did for Akram Khan
Heavliy influenced by Adam Kurtis
and a little of Slavoi Zizek approach to philosophy
Guardian and Intercept daring approach typography and writing

Opinion that web-browser is technological development of the first ever print press.


 This is my first full-fledged digital-design-development project. Along the way I've learnt huge amounts. In my neive arrogance, I've always thought programmatice thinking === programming. Generally, this is true, however what I've found is the level of complexity and detail needed is far greater than I imagined. Keeping on top of this and writing, organised legible code has been my intention throughout this project.

 A few of my most important tutorials, tips and helpers are listed here:
 Patience
 CSS grid

 smaccs
 getting started with terminal
 getting started with jekyll
 https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture
 @Kylie Short, my design mentor who taught me an awful lot about type setting oh and how to pull my finger out and actually work (work ethic). This is closest to an apprenticeship I've ever had and has allowed me to hang off all kinds of theory to the practical advice.

Deisgn tools and influences
Grid theory
Baseline grid stuff


Ambition 
This site will grow legs and lead to more business, I've started researching using NUXT and shoping cart services

Would like to pick up shelved digital ideas and develop

## M4C

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "M4C"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: M4C
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install M4C

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/hello. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `M4C.gemspec` accordingly.
