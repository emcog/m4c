<h1 id="elements-introduction">Elements Introduction</h1>

<p>Amplitude.js comes with a variety of elements. Each element is picked up by a
class prefixed with ‘amplitude-‘ and depending on the environment, an attribute
that relates to the index of a song in your list of songs or a playlist you are
using the element with. There are elements that some events are bound to such
as play and next and other elements that get filled with meta data information
about the active audio.</p>

<p>All elements can be styled simply based off of class or if you want to define
specific ids in CSS. Besides album art, you could apply these classes to a
variety of elements.  Album art has to be an <img /> element, but the other
elements could be whatever.</p>
