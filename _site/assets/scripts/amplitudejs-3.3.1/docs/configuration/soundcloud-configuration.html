<h1 id="soundcloud-configuration">Soundcloud Configuration</h1>
<p>AmplitudeJS supports SoundCloud integration. When adding a song from SoundCloud
use the SoundCloud streamable URL and provide a soundcloud_client in the config.
AmplitudeJS will configure all of the data necessary from the
SoundCloud API to go with the song.  You can even use the album art by setting
the soundcloud_use_art to true in the config during the Amplitude.init() method.</p>
