<h1 id="song-objects">Song Objects</h1>

<p>An array of JSON song objects is required by Amplitude.js.  This directs
AmplitudeJS to the metadata and information necessary for playing the audio.</p>

<p>A basic song object has the following keys:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name = The name of the song</li>
  <li>artist = The song’s artist</li>
  <li>album = The song’s album ( Also used to determine album changes in an
  environment where multiple albums are used on the page)</li>
  <li>url = The URL to the song. This is most imporatant.  (Soundcloud URLs
  discussed later)</li>
  <li>cover_art_url = The URL to the song’s cover art.</li>
  <li>live = Set to true for a URL that is a live audio source.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only actualy required key is the url so Amplitude.js can play the song.</p>

<p>As of Amplitude 3.0, the song object can include any number of keys which can
be displayed anywhere on the page. You can make up a key name if you want like</p>

	</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>and reference it anywhere on your page using the ‘amplitude-song-info’ attribute
on the element you want to display the data like:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	<span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"made-up-key"</span> <span class="na">amplitude-song-info=</span><span class="s">"made_up_key"</span> <span class="na">amplitude-main-song-info=</span><span class="s">"true"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is important to note that in multiple song environments, the order that you
list the songs makes a difference. When utilizing next and previous
functionality, Amplitude.js will iterate over the songs object and go to the
next song or the previous song in the list. If you are using AmplitudeJS in a
playlist type environment, you will define the order of the songs in the playlist
by their individual indexes.</p>

<p>It is also important to note how songs are indexed. Like in almost all
programming, indexes start at 0.  So when you are setting up multiple play/pause
functions or song status sliders that relate to an individual song or playlists,
the indexes are used. For example, the song above named “Song Name 1” would have
an index of 0, “Song Name 2” would have an index of 1, and so on.</p>
